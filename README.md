# Parsley

Build chunks of XML without dependencies.

## Abstract

Render any document structure in XML.

## Notes for developers

I built Parsley to decouple XML from the DOM.

I render lots of stuff in the browser that isn't DOM: audio, video, WebGL, and SVG.

Consistent multimedia experiences can benefit from document structure and being represented in XML.
