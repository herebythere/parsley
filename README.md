# Parsley

Create custom XML documents.

## Abstract

Parsley is a portable library

## About

Parsley is an XML parser helps create custom document structures.

## Install

Clone this repository and copy a version into your codebase.

#### Deno

Import `v0.1` into a deno project.

```ts
import { Chunk } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylor-vann/parsley/main/v0.1/src/parsley.ts";
```

// N Node // A Attributables // P Params // S State

## How to use

Parsley contructs interactive documents from XML through an external interface.

The
[hooks interface](https://github.com/taylor-vann/parsley-dom/blob/main/v0.1/src/hooks/hooks.ts)
in [Parsley-dom](https://github.com/taylor-vann/parsley-dom) uses Parsley to
maintain document structure.

## Plans

Parsley is written in Typescript.

But it's a completely portable set of abstractions ready to be implemented in
other languages.

Rust and C# are the most likely next targets.
